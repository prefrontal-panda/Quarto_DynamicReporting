# Quarto_DynamicReporting
Stores files used to dynamically generate reports based on a dictionary. 

The three files are:
1. 'ReportGen_Dictionary.py': Used to format and make the dictionary used for report generation.
2. 'Class_Dynamic_Report_Draft_v1.0.qmd': quarto file used to format the report and visualise the analysis.
3. 'Run_ReportGen.py': python script to run the  .qmd file.
4. 'Report_Tester.ipynb': Jupyter notebook used to test the plots and figures generated in the report proper.

**NOTE:** Please run the .py files as python [file].py in a terminal.
